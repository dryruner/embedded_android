• History:
Creator: Andy Rubin
• Features:
Dalvik virtual machine: Byte-code interpreter implementation used in Android as a replacement for the Sun Jave virtual machine. Sun VM uses .class files, Dalvik interprets .dex files. These files are generated by the dx utility using the .class files generated by the Java compiler part of the JDK.

Android's development model means that as a developer, your ability to make contributions to Android is limited. However, you are still free to submit enhancements and fixes to the AOSP available at http://android.googlesource.com.

The bulk of the components created by Google for the AOSP are published under the Apache License 2.0 (ASL) with some key components such as the Bionic library (a replacement for glibc and uClibc) and the Toolbox utility (a replacement for busybox), licensed under the BSD license.

• Oracle versus Google:
Java is actually composed mainly of three things: i) The language and its semantics; ii) The virtual machine that runs the Jave byte-code generated by the Java compiler; iii) The class library that contains the packages used by Java application at runtime.
Android relies only on the Java compiler found in JDK for building parts of AOSP. Instead of using Oracle's Java VM, Android replies on Dalvik VM; and instead of using the official class library, Android relies on Apache Harmony, a clean-room reimplementation of the class library.

• Hardware and compliance requirements:
For instance, if you don't have a GPS in your project, you might want to provide a mock GPS HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) module, as Android emulator does, to the AOSP.
You may need to go through the Android Compatibility Program (ACP): including the Compliance Definition Document (CDD) and the Compliance Test Suite (CTS). See "Embedded Android" P17 ~ P22 for more details.

• Development setup and tools:
There are two separate sets of tools for Android development: i) those used for application development, like the book "Learning Android" and http://developer.android.com; ii) those used for platform development, see source code, this book, etc.
